                    <div class="size6">
                        Simply go to <a href="/downloads">here</a>, or join our <a href="/discord">discord

                        Yes, and a lot of them are either heavily modified or outright fake.<br>
                        If you have downloaded his archive, it is highly recommended that you delete it and instead

                    <div class="size6">
                        While the launcher does have some old versions, it isn't even close to every version. For
                        example, at the time of writing this, there is only a single Infdev client in the launcher,
                        yet we have 26.<br>
                        Some of the launcher's versions are also slightly modified.

                    <div class="size6">
                        The archivist role is used to thank people who have made significant contributions to the
                        archive. Most of the time this is by finding versions, though some people have been granted
                        the role for new discoveries that help us with our goal.

                    <h1 class="size3">Do you have [insert version here]?</h1>
                    <div class="size6">
                        Check <a href="/index">the index</a> for a comprehensive list on which versions we do and do
                        not
                        have.

                    <h1 class="size3">How do I know which servers are compatible with which clients?</h1>
                    <div class="size6">
                        Whether or not a client can connect to a server depends on the protocol version number (PVN)
                        of both the client and the server.<br>
                        If the PVN matches, they are compatible.<br>For example,
                        clients a1.0.16 to a1.0.16_02 (inclusive) all have a PVN of 14.<br>
                        Server versions a0.1.2_01 and a0.1.3 also have a PVN of 14, meaning that all those clients
                        are compatible with both
                        those servers.<br><br>

                        To find the PVN of a client or server, take a look at <a href="/index">the index</a>.

                    <h1 class="size3">Why do versions from Infdev and older freeze my entire PC?</h1>
                    <div class="size6">
                        This is a bug with Windows 10 version 1809. This is the only version this bug affects, so to
                        fix it, either update to 1903 (or later), or downgrade to 1803 (or earlier).<br>
                        To check what version of Windows 10 you're using, press Win+R, type winver, and hit enter.
                        The dialogue
                        box that opens will tell you the build of Windows 10 you're running.<br>
                        There is no known way
                        to fix this bug other than to install a build of Windows 10 that isn't affected.
                    </div><br>
                    <h1 class="size3">I think I've found a new version; what do I do?</h1>
                    <div class="size6">
                        Firstly, upload it to Omnibot#4791 in DMs, with the message <code>.identify</code>. The bot
                        will then
                        hash the file and check the result against the index to identify the version. If it can't
                        identify the version, then please send it to <code>HalfOfAKebab#5139</code> in his
                        DMs.<br><br>

                        Here is a screenshot showing how to use <code>.identify</code> properly: <a
                            href="https://i.imgur.com/wmXs1fs.png">Imgur</a>.<br><br>

                        Please do not upload jar files directly in the server, as explained in our server rules.
                    </div><br>
                    <h1 class="size3">How can I be notified when a new version is found?</h1>
                    <div class="size6">
                        Every time a new version is found, it's announced in our discord's <code>#changelog</code>
                        channel along
                        with a ping to the Notification Squad role. To join the Notification Squad, type
                        <code>!role Notification Squad</code> in <code>#bots</code>.<br>

                        You can also use <code>!role Voice Squad</code> to join the Voice Squad role, which
                        anyone can ping
                        to let others know they want to voice chat.<br>
                       
                        Finally you can also be notified of upcoming events with the Event Squad role, to join use 
                        <code>!role Event Squad</code>.

                    <h1 class="size3">How do I fix sounds, skins, and crashes?</h1>
                    <div class="size6">
                        As these versions get older, more things break as Mojang updates their own infrastructure
                        and as computers get newer.<br>
                        Not all of these things can be completely solved, however there
                        are tools generously made by members of our community that iron out some of these
                        problems.<br>

                        Some solutions are listed below. Please note that you should only use one of these tools;
                        using a combination is unsupported and may result in unpredictable or undesired
                        behaviour.<br>

                        To use a proxy, paste them into the JVM arguments field in your launcher profile.<br><br>

                        <b>BetaCraft</b><br>
                        BetaCraft has a proxy and a launcher. The proxy only fixes skins, sounds, and crashes,
                        whereas the launcher has more features.<br>
                        These features include multiplayer authentication,
                        resolution fixes in Classic, Discord RPC support, Classic saving, and more:

                        BetaCraft proxy: <code>-Dhttp.proxyHost=betacraft.pl</code><br>

                        It is also recommended to use the following JVM argument with the BetaCraft proxy:
                        <code>-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true</code><br><br>

                        <b>RetroWrapper</b><br>
                        RetroWrapper fixes some bugs, fixes skins and sounds, adds online saving, and has a
                        teleportation hack and isometric viewer.<br>

                    <h1 class="size3">Why do my graphics freak out on old versions?</h1>
                    <div class="size6">
                        Beta 1.7.3 and older have graphical bugs when using most AMD graphics cards, which is most
                        noticeable when looking at clouds with Fancy graphics.<br><br>

                        The BetaCraft launcher has a fix automatically applied without needing
                        to modify your client jar file.<br>
                        You can download the BetaCraft launcher <a href="https://launcher.betacraft.pl/"> here</a>
                        (direct download).<br><br>

                        Alternatively, HalfOfAKebab has made a mod for a lot of versions that copies code from Beta
                        1.8 (which does not have these graphical issues). You can download it
