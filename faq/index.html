                            Yes, and a lot of them are either heavily modified or outright fake. If you have downloaded
                            his archive, it is highly recommended that you delete it and instead download our archive.

                        <div class="size6">
                            While the launcher does have some old versions, it isn't even close to every version. For
                            example, at the time of writing this, there is only a single Infdev client in the launcher,
                            yet we have 26. Some of the launcher's versions are also slightly modified.

                        <div class="size6">
                            The archivist role is used to thank people who have made significant contributions to the
                            archive. Most of the time this is by finding versions, though some people have been granted
                            the role for new discoveries that help us with our goal.

                        <div class="size6">
                            Check <a href="/index">the index</a> for a comprehensive list on which versions we do and do not
                            have.

                        <h1 class="size3">How do I know which servers are compatible with which clients?</h1>
                        <div class="size6">
                            Whether or not a client can connect to a server depends on the protocol version number (PVN)
                            of both the client and the server. If the PVN matches, they are compatible. For example,
                            clients a1.0.16 to a1.0.16_02 (inclusive) all have a PVN of 14. Server versions a0.1.2_01
                            and a0.1.3 also have a PVN of 14, meaning that all those clients are compatible with both
                            those servers.

                            To find the PVN of a client or server, take a look at <a href="/index">the index</a>.

                        <h1 class="size3">Why do versions from Infdev and older freeze my entire PC?</h1>
                        <div class="size6">
                            This is a bug with Windows 10 version 1809. This is the only version this bug affects, so to
                            fix it, either update to 1903 (or later), or downgrade to 1803 (or earlier). To check what
                            version of Windows 10 you're using, press Win+R, type winver, and hit enter. The dialogue
                            box that opens will tell you the build of Windows 10 you're running. There is no known way
                            to fix this bug other than to install a build of Windows 10 that isn't affected.

                        <h1 class="size3">I think I've found a new version; what do I do?</h1>
                        <div class="size6">
                            Firstly, upload it to Omnibot#4791 in DMs, with the message .identify. The bot will then
                            hash the file and check the result against the index to identify the version. If it can't
                            identify the version, then please send it to HalfOfAKebab#5139 in his DMs.

                            Here is a screenshot showing how to use .identify properly: https://i.imgur.com/wmXs1fs.png.

                            Please do not upload jar files directly in the server, as explained in our server rules.

                        <h1 class="size3">How can I be notified when a new version is found?</h1>
                        <div class="size6">
                            Every time a new version is found, it's announced in our discod's #changelog channel along
                            with a ping to the Notification Squad role. To join the Notification Squad, type
                            .notificationsquad in #omniarchive or #bots.<br>

                            (Note that you can also use .voicesquad to join the Voice Squad role, which anyone can ping
                            to let others know they want to voice chat.)

                        <h1 class="size3">How do I fix sounds, skins, and crashes?</h1>
                        <div class="size6">
                            As these versions get older, more things break as Mojang updates their own infrastructure
                            and as computers get newer. Not all of these things can be completely solved, however there
                            are tools generously made by members of our community that iron out some of these
                            problems.<br>

                            Some solutions are listed below. Please note that you should only use one of these tools;
                            using a combination is unsupported and may result in unpredictable or undesired
                            behaviour.<br>

                            To use a proxy, paste them into the JVM arguments field in your launcher profile.<br><br>

                            BetaCraft<br>
                            BetaCraft has a proxy and a launcher. The proxy only fixes skins, sounds, and crashes,
                            whereas the launcher has more features. These features include multiplayer authentication,
                            resolution fixes in Classic, Discord RPC support, Classic saving, and more:
                            https://github.com/Moresteck/BetaCraft-Launcher-Java/wiki .<br>

                            BetaCraft launcher: https://github.com/Moresteck/BetaCraft-Launcher-Java/releases
                            BetaCraft proxy: -Dhttp.proxyHost=betacraft.pl.<br>

                            It is also recommended to use the following JVM argument with the BetaCraft proxy:
                            -Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true.<br><br>

                            MineOnline<br>
                            MineOnline is a launcher that provides fixes for crashes, skins and capes, authentication,
                            and sounds, and adds many features such as FOV scaling, texture pack support for every
                            version (including Classic), Discord RPC integration, and more. Download and more
                            information at: https://mineonline.codie.gg/ .<br><br>

                            RetroWrapper<br>
                            RetroWrapper fixes some bugs, fixes skins and sounds, adds online saving, and has a
                            teleportation hack and isometric viewer. Find the download and installation instructions
                            here: https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/RetroWrapper .<br>

                        <h1 class="size3">Why do my graphics freak out on old versions?</h1>
                        <div class="size6">
                            Beta 1.7.3 and older have graphical bugs when using most AMD graphics cards, which is most
                            noticeable when looking at clouds with Fancy graphics.<br><br>

                            Both BetaCraft and MineOnline launchers have a fix automatically applied without needing
                            to modify your client jar file. You can download the BetaCraft launcher
                            <a href="https://launcher.betacraft.pl/"> here</a> (direct download), and the MineOnline
                            launcher
                            <a href="https://mineonline.codie.gg/"> here</a>.<br><br>

                            Alternatively, HalfOfAKebab has made a mod for a lot of versions that copies code from Beta
                            1.8 (which does not have these graphical issues). You can download it
