                                Omniarchive is an archive community that focuses on archival of all official editions of
                                Minecraft. Although we don't have any official archives of fanmade content, many in the
                                community also actively archive mods, tools and worlds, especially from Minecraft's
                                early community.<br>
                                Although we archive all editions of Minecraft, our main focus and what we are best known
                                for is finding and archiving old versions of Minecraft Java Edition from its early
                                history that have become lost to time and are not available in the official Minecraft
                                launcher or from any third party sources. Many members of the community also actively
                                focus on documentation of the early history of Minecraft and the community at the time,
                                so it can be preserved for all to see (e.g. Finding proof of existence of versions,
                                contributing information to the official wiki, archiving screenshots and videos).<br>

                                Since our inception on September 24th 2017 by HalfOfAKebab, we have recovered 80+
                                previously missing Minecraft Java Edition versions, mostly from the game's early
                                development stages in 2009-2010. We are always actively looking for more version finds,
                                with our usual methods being to contact old players from the time. Our last major find
                                was 3 Classic versions, 2 Indev versions and a previously missing version of Minecraft
                                4k in mid-October 2020.<br>

                                Outside of archival, we also have a large discord community focused on a shared love of
                                old versions of Minecraft, as well as the game in general including newer versions. We
                                have also hosted a few mostly unplanned events in the server that the community found
                                very enjoyable, and we aim to make these more of a regular occurence in future.

                                - Omni and LMM basically got everything that was online in 2017-early 2018, a lot of
                                which had been for years at that point (2010-2013 sort of time I think) including
                                0.0.13a_03, 0.0.23a_01, 0.30, 0.30 ST, in-20100223, in-20100130, in-20100203,
                                inf-20100227, inf-20100415, inf-20100420, inf-20100608, inf-20100627 etc. Basically if
                                it isn't mentioned elsewhere it was probably found before Omni.<br>
                                - 17th September 2017, Zuriki, this was originally in LMM though but also given to omni
                                later on, basically everything from the og retrocraft site except for the infdevs. Which
                                I think is 0.27, 0.28_01, 0.29_02, 0.0.21a, in-20100111-1, in-20100125-1 and -2,
                                basically anything after and including in-20100207-1, except for in-20100207-2 and
                                anything already found (in-20100223)<br>
                                - 14th October 2017 Lucario found a texture modded a1.0.1_01 on an old forum thread.<br>
                                - 4th April 2018, DBN: in-20100201-1, 0.0.22a_05, inf-20100327. (First one I was here
                                personally for)<br>
                                - 20th April 2018, bildramer: in-20100129.
                                Also in his zip was what we now know as RC2-1 (previously RCX) but somehow we managed to
                                miss this for literally over a year lmao.<br>
                                - 25th April 2018, GCB found texture modded inf-20100330 on the MCForums from an old
                                thread.<br>
                                - 12th May 2018, calzoneman: in-20100131 and in-20100201-2.<br>
                                - 22nd May 2018, UnknownX: All of the remaining versions from the original retrocraft
                                website, which was inf-20100607, inf-20100624, inf-20100625-1 and -2, inf-20100629 and
                                one of the in-20100207 ones, I can't remember if it was -2 or -1 but we had one of them
                                before him. Some of these were texture modded (a couple of the infdevs) and he also gave
                                us a1.0.1_01 non texture modded.<br>
                                - 10th June 2018, RidgeX:
                                A shit ton of versions, you know the story, there's lists out there somewhere but it was
                                like almost every other infdev and lots more. Includes all the non modified versions of
                                the ones sent by UnknownX.<br>
                                - 18th March 2019, Searge: a1.2.3_05. Him and Dinnerbone also sent a lot of previously
                                missing beta and I think release prerelease servers.<br>
                                - 22nd March 2019, joeyjo0: 0.29_01 texture modded (literally just the rain texture
                                though)<br>
                                - 20th October 2019, Rotab: 0.0.14a_08 and 0.0.16a_02(-2)<br>
                                - 13th April 2020, Testvan: 0.0.15a-1<br><br>
